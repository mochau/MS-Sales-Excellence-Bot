# Microsoft Sales Excellence Bot
Microsoft Teams Web Bot built as a proof of concept to provide support for the wider team within the Specialist Technical Unit within Microsoft - helping with user questions with future plans with a CRM integration. This was built on Microsoft Azure using the Microsoft Bot Framework and Microsoft QnA Maker API.

# QnA Maker service
QnA Maker enables you to power a question and answer service from your semi-structured content.

One of the basic requirements in writing your own bot is to seed it with questions and answers. In many cases, the questions and answers already exist in content like FAQ URLs/documents, product manuals, etc. With QnA Maker, users can query your application in a natural, conversational manner. QnA Maker uses machine learning to extract relevant question-answer pairs from your content. It also uses powerful matching and ranking algorithms to provide the best possible match between the user query and the questions.

# Deploy the bot to Azure
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.
